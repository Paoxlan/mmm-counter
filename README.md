# mmm counter
"Tiny" joke bot I made for a discord server. A bot that counts how many times someone says "mmm" in the text channels, and it supports slash commands.

This bot uses discord.js.

## What it does
- Sending a message with "mmm" included will increase your mmm count by 1.
- You can purchase upgrades with the `/shop` command to boost your productivity.
- mmm coins are earned by the same way as mmm count, but you can also get them passively from upgrades.

## Invite
- [The Discord bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1161609471307558933&permissions=67584&scope=bot)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, but don't expect me to react quickly as this project was made as a joke and I don't plan on working on it much.

**New features need to be discussed in an issue first. Bug fixes can be done without an issue.**
